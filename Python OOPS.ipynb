What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","  \n","    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm that structures code around objects rather than functions and logic, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","\n","    a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior and properties of those objects.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","\n","    An object in Python is an instance of a class. While a class is the blueprint, an object is the real entity created from that blueprint.\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n","    -Both abstraction and encapsulation are core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, but they focus on different aspects of hiding and controlling details.\n","    \n","    Abstraction - Hides the implementation details from the user and only exposes the essential functionality. Its purpose is to focus on what an object does, not how it does it. Using abstract classes and abstract methods (via abc module). One can’t create an object of an abstract class.\n","    \n","    Encapsulation - Hides the data (attributes) inside the class and restricts direct access, allowing controlled access through methods. It helps in data protection and security.By using private (__var) or protected (_var) attributes.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","    \n","    -Dunder methods in Python (also called magic methods or special methods) are methods with double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of their names, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc. They allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in operations, such as:\n","\n","    Initialization\n","\n","    String representation\n","\n","    Arithmetic operations\n","    \n","    Comparisons\n","\n"," 6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPs?\n","\n","    -Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass).\n","\n","    It promotes code reusability, hierarchical classification, and extensibility.\n","    \n","    Key Concepts\n","    Parent Class (Superclass): The class whose properties and methods are inherited.\n","    Child Class (Subclass): The class that inherits from the parent class.\n","    super() function: Used to call the parent class methods/constructor in the child class.\n","\n","    types of Inheritance in Python:\n","    Single Inheritance: One child, one parent.\n","    Multiple Inheritance: Child inherits from multiple parents.\n","    Multilevel Inheritance: Child → Parent → Grandparent.\n","    Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple children from the same parent.\n","    Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of the above.\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","    -Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means one interface, multiple implementations. It allows different classes to define methods with the same name but with different behaviors, making code more flexible and reusable.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","    -Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) inside a class and restricting direct access to the data, allowing controlled access through methods.\n","    \n","    This ensures data security, integrity, and controlled modification.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","    -A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created from a class. In Python, the constructor is defined using the __init__ method.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","    In Python, class methods and static methods are special methods that belong to a class but serve different purposes.\n","    Class Method - A class method is a method that operates on the class itself, not on an instance.\n","      \n","      It can access and modify class variables.\n","      \n","      Declared using the @classmethod decorator.\n","      \n","      The first parameter is cls, which refers to the class.\n","      \n","      Use Cases\n","      \n","      ✔ Modify class-level data\n","      \n","      ✔ Provide alternative constructors\n","\n","    Static Method - A static method is a method that does not depend on the class or instance.\n","    It is logically related to the class, but doesn’t need cls or self.\n","    Declared using the @staticmethod decorator.\n","    \n","    Use Cases\n","\n","    ✔ Utility functions (e.g., calculations, validations)\n","\n","    ✔ Operations that don’t modify class or instance data\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","    \n","    Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters so they can perform different tasks based on the arguments passed.\n","    \n","    However, Python does NOT support traditional method overloading like Java or C++ because functions in Python are dynamically typed and the last defined method overrides the previous ones.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","    Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n","    The method name and parameters must be the same, and the child class version replaces (overrides) the parent class version at runtime.\n","    \n","    Key Characteristics\n","    - Happens in inheritance.\n","    - Same method name, same parameters, different implementation.\n","    - Achieved at runtime (called runtime polymorphism).\n","    - Often combined with super() to call the parent method.\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","    \n","    The @property decorator in Python is used to define getters in an object-oriented way, so you can access methods like attributes (without parentheses). It is part of Python’s descriptor protocol and is often used to implement encapsulation cleanly.\n","    \n","    Why use @property?\n","    - To control access to an attribute (read-only or computed values).\n","    - To hide method calls behind attribute-like access for cleaner syntax.\n","    - To replace explicit getter/setter methods.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","      - Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it provides flexibility, scalability, and reusability in code. It allows the same interface (method name or operator) to behave differently for different types of objects, which is crucial for clean and maintainable software design.\n","\n","15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","      - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes. It can define abstract methods (methods with no implementation) that must be implemented by subclasses.\n","      \n","      Python uses the abc (Abstract Base Class) module to create abstract classes.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","    - The advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python include better code organization, reusability, and scalability. OOP in Python is built around classes and objects, and it provides several benefits for writing maintainable and flexible applications.\n","\n","17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","    - The difference between a class variable and an instance variable in Python lies in how they are stored and shared among objects.\n","      \n","      1. Class Variable\n","        Belongs to the class.\n","        Shared by all instances of the class.\n","        Defined inside the class but outside any instance methods.\n","        Changing it through the class affects all instances.\n","\n","      2. Instance Variable\n","      Belongs to the specific object (instance).\n","      Different for each instance of the class.\n","      Defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self.\n","      Changing it affects only that instance.\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","  - Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to access attributes and methods from multiple base classes, promoting code reusability and flexibility.\n","    \n","    Key Points\n","    \n","    Python supports multiple inheritance (unlike some languages like Java).\n","    The child class inherits features from two or more parent classes.\n","    Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines the order in which methods are searched when called.\n","\n","19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n","    \n","    -In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods that define how an object is represented as a string. Both control string representation, but they serve different purposes.\n","    \n","    __str__ (Human-readable representation)\n","    Used by print() and str() functions. It makes the output readable and user-friendly. Meant for end users.\n","\n","    __repr__ (Developer/debug representation)\n","    Used by repr() and in interactive shell. Give an unambiguous representation of the object (for debugging). Meant for developers. Ideally returns a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","    The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class inside a child class. It plays an important role in inheritance, especially with method overriding and multiple inheritance.\n","    \n","    Significance of super()\n","     -Calls parent class methods without explicitly naming the parent class.\n","     -Supports multiple inheritance by following the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n","     -Improves maintainability – if the parent class name changes, the code still works.\n","     -Allows extending functionality of parent methods instead of completely overriding them.\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","    -The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method, which is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when its reference count reaches zero, or during garbage collection).\n","\n","22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","    - The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in how they access class or instance data and what arguments they receive by default.\n","    \n","    1. @staticmethod\n","     \n","     Belongs to the class, but does not have access to the class (cls) or instance (self).\n","     Works like a regular function inside a class, but grouped logically.\n","     Cannot modify class state or instance state.\n","     No default argument (other than what you pass explicitly).\n","\n","    2. @classmethod\n","\n","      Receives the class itself as the first argument (cls).\n","      Can access and modify class variables but not instance-specific data (unless you create an instance inside).\n","      Useful for factory methods (creating objects in different ways).\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","    -Polymorphism in Python with inheritance means that a child class can provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class, and the correct version is called at runtime depending on the object type.\n","    \n","    This is typically achieved through method overriding.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","    - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement, one after another.\n","    This works because each method returns self (the object instance), allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","\n","    - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you define __call__ inside a class, you can use object_name() syntax, and Python will execute the __call__ method."],"metadata":{"id":"JqtY9fldyhZY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"ka83c1JBBNwS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
